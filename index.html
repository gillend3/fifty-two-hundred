    <h1>50-200</h1>
    <h2 class="subtitle">This app is based on a suggested writing exercise from George Saunders. The idea is to write a 200-word short<br> story (exactly 200—not a word more or less) using fifty unique words or less. When faced with these<br> constraints, particularly the inability to over-describe things, writers often respond by driving the narrative<br> forward (because, after all, what else is there to do!), which leads to rising action—the heart of a short<br> story.<br></h2>
    <h2 class="subtitle"><u>Start typing away on your short story. The app will keep track of each unique word for you and<br> present them in a list. When you’ve used fifty unique words, you won’t be able to introduce anymore.<br> You also won’t be able to type over two-hundred words. You can use the Copy button at the bottom<br> if you want to copy & paste your work into a word processor.</h2>
